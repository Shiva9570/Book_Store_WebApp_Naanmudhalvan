### Explanation of Changes
1. **Image Embedding Code:**
   - **Email:** Added `<img>` with a link using `https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/email.png`.
   - **Instagram:** Used `<img>` with a link pointing to `https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/instagram-new.png`.

2. **Clickable Links:**  
   Icons now link directly to the email client or Instagram profile.

### How It Works
- GitHub allows embedding remote images in README files using HTML `<img>` tags.
- Icons are sourced from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/), a reliable source for free icons.

You can now copy-paste this code, and the logos will appear in your README file. Let me know if you need further assistance!
