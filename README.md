Code Implementation

1. README.md

This serves as the front page of your repository.

# Book Store Repository

Welcome to the Book Store repository! Here, you can find a collection of books and a preview video.

## Repository Contents

- **`books/`**: Contains all book PDFs.
- **`scripts/`**: Scripts to automate book management.
- **`previews/`**: Video previews.

## Preview

## Usage

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore.git
cd bookstore

Add a new book

./scripts/add_book.sh "path-to-book.pdf"

View Preview

Open previews/VID-20241115-WA0006.mp4 in any video player.

#### 2. **Scripts for Automation**

**`setup.sh`: Initialize the Repository**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Setup repository with necessary folders

mkdir -p books previews scripts
touch .gitignore README.md
echo "Setup completed."

add_book.sh: Add a New Book

#!/bin/bash
# Script to add a new book

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <path-to-book>"
  exit 1
fi

cp "$1" books/
echo "Book $(basename "$1") added to the repository."


---

3. Git Commands

Run these commands to set up your repository:

# Initialize the repository
git init

# Add all files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with scripts and README"

# Link to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/bookstore.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

4. Preview Video Setup

Place your video (VID-20241115-WA0006.mp4) in the previews/ directory. You can modify the README link to point to this video file for easy access.
